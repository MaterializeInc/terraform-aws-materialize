After successfully deploying the infrastructure with this module, you'll need to:

1. (Optional) Configure storage classes
1. Install the [Materialize Operator](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/tree/main/misc/helm-charts/operator)
1. Deploy your first Materialize environment

See our [Operator Installation Guide](docs/operator-setup.md) for instructions.
